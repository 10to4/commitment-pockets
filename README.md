# Commitment pockets

 Just a toy.

## Goal

As we know, polynomial commitment and vector commitment are two of significant parts for zero knowledge proof. Most of zerk knowledge schemes use these commitments, including Plonk, Hyrax, Spartan, Nova, and so on. We can find most of different kinds of polynomial commitments and vector commitments are all the variations of KZG10. They look like a bunch of permutation of some tricks and schemes.

So if we can concombine strcut those commitment schemes to a libaray, it will be useful.
* First of all, we create a series uniform interfaces for these different schemes, so that it is convenient for developers to use any scheme they want conveniently.
* Then like a collection, it can be convenient to compare the differences between the various schemes, as well as the inextericable connection.
* Last but not least, it also can be a good tool for learners to learn more about the details of polynomial commitment and vector commitment.
